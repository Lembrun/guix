    (description
     "Execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, separated into a
parser (execlineb) and a set of commands meant to execute one another in a
chain-execution fashion, storing the whole script in the argument array.
It features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, file name
globbing, redirection and other shell concepts, expressed as discrete commands
rather than in special syntax, minimizing runtime footprint and
complexity.")))
