    (description
      "On the surface, Enchant appears to be a generic spell checking library.
Looking closer, you'll see the Enchant is more-or-less a fancy wrapper around
the dlopen() system call.

Enchant steps in to provide uniformity and conformity on top of these libraries,
and implement certain features that may be lacking in any individual provider
library.  Everything should \"just work\" for any and every definition of \"just
working\".")
