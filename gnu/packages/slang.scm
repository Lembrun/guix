    (description
     "S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a
developer to create robust multi-platform software.  It provides facilities
required by interactive applications such as display/screen management,
keyboard input, keymaps, and so on.  The most exciting feature of the library
is the slang interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program to make it
extensible.  While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of the
interpreter, it may also be used in a stand-alone fashion through the use of
slsh, which is part of the S-Lang distribution.")
